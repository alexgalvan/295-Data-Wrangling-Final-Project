This is a repository for the data and code used in 295 Data Wrangling at Rutgers University. I've added the html and pdf versions as well.

To access the bls data and api, you'll need to request an api key at the bls website and install the bls api package which Ive commented out in the code.

Thank you for taking the time to check this out, I had fun working on it!
